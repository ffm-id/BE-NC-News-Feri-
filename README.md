This project will have two databases. One for real looking dev data and the other one is for simpler test data. Please create two .env files (`.env.test` and `.env.development`) in order to successfully connect to the two databases locally. Into each, you can add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for each environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). You can see .env files example in `.env-example`.
